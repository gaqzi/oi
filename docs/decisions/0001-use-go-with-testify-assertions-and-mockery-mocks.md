# Use Go with testify assertions and mockery mocks

Go and expected version will be tracked in `.tool-versions`.

[Stretchr's Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) assertion library.

[Vektra's mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) for generating mocks.

## Context and Problem Statement

This project is built to solve a problem and to highlight development practices. It's not an exploration in tools. 

## Decision Drivers

* **Familiarity:** focus on what allows me to make progress 
* **Helping developers who know Go:** because that's my intended audience with the development practices

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Use the tools I already know
* Option 2: Explore the most popular tools and use them

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use the tools I already know", because it allows me to focus on the writing and development, which meets the decision drivers.

### Consequences

* Good, because it keeps Björn effective
* Good, because Go developers from his work can hopefully learn from this project
* Bad, because it's not considering the options and introducing potentially better tools
